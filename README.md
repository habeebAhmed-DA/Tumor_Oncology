# Tumor_Oncology

🧬 Oncology Survival & Treatment Analysis Dashboard <br>
📌 Project Overview

This project explores cancer survival patterns using an end-to-end data analysis approach. The goal was to understand how survival outcomes vary based on tumor type, treatment, response category, age group, and tumor size.

I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to filter and explore survival insights dynamically.

🎯 Why I Built This

I wanted to work on a healthcare-focused dataset that would allow me to practice:

💠 Cleaning and structuring raw data <br>
💠 Writing SQL queries <br>
💠 Building calculated measures in Power BI <br>
💠 Designing interactive dashboards that answer real analytical questions <br>
💠 This project helped me connect data processing with meaningful insight generation. <br>

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

💠 Dataset Source: Kaggle (Cancer dataset for educational purposes) <br>
💠 Data Cleaning: Microsoft Excel <br>
💠 Database & Querying: MySQL <br>
💠 Data Modeling & Visualization: Power BI <br>
💠 DAX: Survival rate calculations, response analysis, KPIs. <br>

🔄 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Collected dataset from Kaggle. <br>
2️⃣ Cleaned and standardized data in Excel. <br>
3️⃣ Imported structured data into MySQL. <br>
4️⃣ Queried and validated data using SQL. <br>
5️⃣ Connected database to Power BI. <br>
6️⃣ Created data model and calculated measures. <br>
7️⃣ Designed an interactive survival dashboard with slicers. <br>
