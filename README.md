## 🧬 Oncology Survival & Treatment Analysis Dashboard
### 📌 Project Overview

This project explores cancer survival patterns using an end-to-end data analysis approach. The goal was to understand how survival outcomes vary based on tumor type, treatment, response category, age group, and tumor size. I developed an interactive healthcare analytics dashboard using **MySQL, Excel, and Power BI,** enabling users to dynamically filter data and uncover meaningful survival insights.

### 📂Dataset Overview
The dataset for this project came from ***Kaggle***, a well-known platform for data science and analytics projects. It includes structured clinical and treatment-related data on cancer patients. The information supports analysis of tumor characteristics, treatment effectiveness, and survival outcomes through interactive visualizations.<br>
I imported the dataset into **MySQL** for querying, handled preprocessing in **Microsoft Excel**, and built the final dashboards in **Microsoft Power BI**. This workflow connected raw clinical data to clear, actionable survival insights.
<br>


### 📊 Dataset Columns Description
The dataset includes the following key attributes:<br>
1. **Patient_ID**  – Unique identifier assigned to each patient <br>
2. **Age** – Age of the patient at diagnosis 🔑  <br>
3. **Gender** – Patient’s gender (Male and Female) <br>
4. **Tumor_Size** (cm) – Measured size of the tumor in centimeters <br>
5. **Tumor_Type** – Classification/type of tumor 🔑 <br>
6. **Biopsy_Result** – Diagnostic confirmation (e.g., benign or malignant) <br>
7. **Treatment** – Type of treatment administered  (e.g., chemotherapy, surgery, radiation) 🔑 <br>
8. **Response_to_Treatment** – Indicates whether the patient responded positively, negatively, or showed no change 🔑 <br>
9. **Survival_Stats** – Survival outcome or duration after treatment 🔑 <br>

### 🎯 Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze patient clinical data and identify patterns influencing treatment response and survival outcomes.

I used MySQL for **Data Extraction**, Microsoft Excel for **Preprocessing** and **Data Cleaning**, and Microsoft Power BI for **Interactive Visualization**. This workflow turned structured clinical data into clear, decision-focused insights on tumor characteristics, treatment effectiveness, and demographic factors affecting survival rates.

The final dashboard allows users to filter data by age, gender, tumor type, and treatment type. This dynamic exploration makes survival trends and performance metrics easier to understand and compare.
